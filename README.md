# Continuous-Seismic-Spectrograms
Obspy code that generates continuous spectrograms from FDSN listed seismic stations.

Simply setup the client, network, list of stations, channels, start and end times. The script will generate continuous spectrograms and traces from those stations. A handy script for exploratory purposes in observational seismology.
